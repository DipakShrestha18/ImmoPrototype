<p align="left">NON ATTRIBUTABLE: MPA "A PEACEFUL PRESIDENTIAL VISIT - BUT SECURITY 

  REMAINS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE" </p>

<p align="left">"The peaceful conclusion of the American President's State Visit 

  to the capital is testament to the professionalism of the Metropolitan Police 

  Service. </p>

<p align="left">Tens of thousands were able to voice their protest in a legitimate 

  and orderly manner, as is their democratic right, thanks to constructive negotiations 

  between the Met and protest organisers. This successful process enabled the 

  police to ensure security considerations remained paramount and were not compromised 

  for visiting dignitaries and protestors alike. </p>

<p align="left">"I would like to put on record that the Metropolitan Police Authority 

  supports the Commissioner and his staff one hundred percent in their tireless 

  work to ensure the safety of London and its communities." Officers deployed 

  for the visit:<br>

  Tuesday - 2,385 officer shifts<br>

  Wednesday - 4,307 officer shifts<br>

  Thursday - 5,123 officer shifts<br>

  Friday - 1,700 officer shifts<br>

  The figures are the total deployed for each day. Some officers will be working 

  more than once shift and so will be counted more than once. At this stage we 

  continue to have approximately 14,000 shifts over the entire four day visit 

  working 24 hours per day...<br>
